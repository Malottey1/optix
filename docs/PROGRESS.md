# Progress log (overnight run)

Branch: `overnight`. Started 2026-10-21 07:08 local.

## Steps

### Step 0. Housekeeping
- (a) CSVs are now written with `lineterminator="\n"`; regenerated; `git add` shows no CRLF warnings.
- (b) Showcase trap margins are computed by `data_gen.traps.trap_margins` and stored in
  `ground_truth.json` (`showcase.trap_margins`). Before: two thresholds were within 10%
  (spam low-xG share 0.769 vs 0.75, +2.6%; volume-passer wide share 0.86 vs 0.80, +7.5%).
  The seed search now requires every threshold cleared by >= 10% (`SHOWCASE_MIN_MARGIN`).
  New showcase: seed 20264547, AUR 2-1 NOR. Numbers: chaser tilt 0.762 (>=0.68, +12%), box
  entries 14 of 147 final-third passes (share 0.095 <= 0.15), 16 of 19 NOR shots low-xG (share
  0.842, mean xG 0.058), volume passer rank 1 with wide share 0.925, corner specialist 6 corner
  chances vs 0 open play, AUR left share 0.613 of 31 entries. Smallest margin +12.1%.
- (c) `@pytest.mark.slow` registered in pyproject.toml, deselected by default (`addopts = -m 'not slow'`).
  Run them with `pytest -m slow`, or everything with `pytest -m ""`.
- Tests: 41 passed, 2 slow deselected (both slow pass).

## Decisions
- Showcase seed search starts from a recorded offset (`SHOWCASE_SEARCH_START = {2026: 4547}`) because
  a search from 0 with the 10% margin takes ~2 minutes and every test fixture regenerates the data.
  A slow test re-runs the search from 0 and checks it finds the same seed, so the hint only skips work.
- Slow tests chosen: multi-seed calibration and the search-from-zero check. The determinism test stays
  in the default run because it is the cheapest guard against non-determinism.
